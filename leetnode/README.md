# The LeetNode Website

This folder houses all frontend and backend code for the LeetNode website. This is built with the T3-Stack but with REST APIs instead of tRPC for the frontned backend communication. 

The T3-Stack:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Next-Auth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- ~~[tRPC](https://trpc.io)~~ [REST APIs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)

## Setup

Always perform these steps to get the most recent changes and install any new dependencies:
```bash
git pull
cd leetnode
npm install
```

Run Dev on `localhost:3000` (try to keep this port clear as dev configs are using this port)
```bash
npm run dev
```

Prisma Studio Script (interactively view database)
```bash
npm run studio
```
